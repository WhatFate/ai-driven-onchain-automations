# Kairos — AI-Driven Onchain Automations (DeFi Copilot)

**Kairos** is an AI-powered onchain automation framework that lets users create, manage, and execute blockchain workflows using natural language.  
Think of it as **“Zapier for DeFi”** — an AI copilot that turns your commands into autonomous smart contract actions.

## Overview

With Kairos, you can automate onchain actions like transfers, swaps, or staking conditions — all through simple text.

### Example Commands

> “If ETH price reaches $2500 — send 0.1 ETH to this address.”  
> “Every Monday, transfer 5 USDC to my subscription contract.”  
> “When my balance falls below 0.5 ETH, top it up with 0.1 from Polygon.”

The AI agent parses these intents and generates executable workflows stored on-chain.

## How It Works

### 1. **AI Interface Layer**
- User interacts via chat.
- The AI parses intent and outputs a structured JSON:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "price",
    "asset": "ETH",
    "operator": ">=",
    "value": 2500
  },
  "action": {
    "token": "ETH",
    "amount": 0.1,
    "to": "0xAbC123..."
  }
}
```

This JSON is sent to the backend through a secure REST API or webhook.

### 2. **Backend / AI Executor**

* Stores user workflows and links them to wallet addresses.
* Generates the corresponding smart contract calls.
* Handles signature requests and trigger validation.

### 3. **Smart Contract Layer (Solidity)**

* Keeps workflow definitions (condition → action).
* Executes actions deterministically when triggers fire.
* Enforces limits: amount caps, frequency, expiration time.

### 4. **Off-chain Agent / Oracle**

* Monitors onchain/offchain data (e.g., prices via Chainlink).
* Calls `execute()` when conditions are met.
* Ensures reliable automation without constant onchain polling.

### 5. **User Notifications**

* When an automation runs, the AI notifies the user:

  > “Condition met — sent 0.1 ETH to 0xAbC123…”

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| AI Parsing Layer   | OpenAI / Llama / Custom LLM        |
| Smart Contracts    | Solidity (EVM-compatible networks) |
| Off-chain Agent    | Node.js / Python                   |
| Price Data         | Chainlink / Band Protocol          |
| Frontend           | Next.js + wagmi + RainbowKit       |

## Why Kairos?

* **No-code automation:** Create DeFi workflows by simply typing commands.
* **AI-native UX:** Natural language → smart contract execution.
* **Secure by design:** Onchain permission control for each agent.
* **Composability:** Plug-and-play with any EVM protocol or oracle.

## Potential Extensions

* **Automation Marketplace** for reusable “if-this-then-that” workflows.
* **DAO governance** for managing shared automations.
* **AI-based portfolio balancing** and real-time strategy execution.

## Example Workflow (MVP Phase)

**Trigger:** ETH price ≥ $2500
**Action:** Send 0.1 ETH to `0xAbC123...`

**Flow:**

1. AI parses command and stores workflow.
2. Off-chain agent watches ETH/USD price via Chainlink.
3. When triggered, backend executes smart contract call.
4. User gets notification:
    “0.1 ETH successfully transferred.”
